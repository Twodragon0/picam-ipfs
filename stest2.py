# Record video from Raspberry Pi camera in .h264 with in-frame text
# showing time/date, and count emitted video frames using a custom output
# which is called when buffers for each frame is ready. 

# The output class may  be called more than once per frame,
# if the picture data is larger than one buffer, \
# so need to check if camera.frame.index has changed, and
# also some buffers are not I/P image frames, so need to ignore those.

# Recommend to increase priority with 'sudo chrt -r -p 99 <pid>'
