# Argument substitution done by PiKrellCam before running this script:
#   $C - scripts directory so this script is found.
#   $F - the preview jpeg filename full path (from MJPEG_DIR)
#   $m - the media directory full path
#   $P - the command FIFO
#   $G - log file configured in ~/.pikrellcam/pikrellcam.conf.
#   $i	 width of the motion detected area in the preview jpeg
#   $J	 height of the motion detected area in the preview jpeg
#   $K	 x coordinate of the motion detected area center in the preview jpeg

# preview_save_mode is "first" because if the mode is "best" the still will
# be taken after the action has ended.  So use the on_motion_begin command
# to take a still if preview_save_mode is "best".  The on_motion_begin
# command can be a script like this or the internal command "@still"
# Note that taking a full resolution still can put a glitch into the motion
# video being recorded because the camera has to switch modes.

# The default here is to save the thumb into the media_dir/stills directory
# so a name is created with a ".th" inserted into the PREVIEW_JPEG name in case
# saving the full jpeg has also been enabled to save to the same directory.
